## Devlog
I would like to use a stage performance as a metaphor. In order to make the relationships between Components, GameObjects, and Scenes more visual.
Scene is the environment for a stage performance---the stage. A stage can place different actors. Unity Scene is where you place different GameObjects.
GameObjects are actors on that stage. They are the core object in the Scene, just like how actors are the central figures in a stage show.
The Components are the scripts that a director gives to actors. Components give GameObjects specific functions, much like how a script assigns actors distinct roles and tells them what to do. For example, a Player Component lets a GameObject can be control by WASD, like an actor following their script to perform actions.
